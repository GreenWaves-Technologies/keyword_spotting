== how to use the generators

generator parameters are in MFCC.h

FFT size, Framesize, min and max freq for mel coeffficients
NDCT DCT size, NUMCEP number of coefficients

BuildFilterBAnk.c to generate the MFCC filterbank coefficients

compile:
gcc BuildFilterBank.c -o BuildFilter -lm

execute
./BuildFilter

result is in MFCC_FB40.def


buildLut.c to genertae Hamming, FFT twiddles, bit reverse tables

compile:
gcc BuildLUT.c twiddle_swap.c  -o BuildLUT -DHAMMING -DTWIDDLES -DSWAP -lm

execute
./BuildLUT

result is in LUT.def

The fft used in the MFCC is a radix 2 implementation.
The dct is implemented using an fft of double size (twiddles_128 and swap_128) followed by a construction stage (twidend)
